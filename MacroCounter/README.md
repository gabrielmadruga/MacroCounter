# MacroCounter

This is an app for mesuring what you eat.

In this app you:
- Set goals.
- Register what you eat.
- Make sure you achive your goals.

## Setting goals
Setting the user goals for the first time should be part of an onboarding process. Usually this is set using a calculator that gives you the total calories from you weight and activity level and you know in which proportion of macros you want to get you calories from
Another usefull feature could be to set different goals for workout vs non workout days

## Registering what you eat

## Review your progress
- Daily review
- Week/Month view. View streak? how many days did I reach, didn't reach, or surpased the goal?
