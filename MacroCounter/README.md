In this app you:

## Setting goals
Setting the user goals for the first time should be part of an onboarding process. Usually this is set using a calculator that gives you the total calories from you weight and activity level and you know in which proportion of macros you want to get you calories from
Another usefull feature could be to set different goals for workout vs non workout days
